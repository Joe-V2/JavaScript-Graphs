# JavaScript Graphs
A couple of graphs I made for the visualisation module of my Computer Science Bachelor's.

There's an interactive radar chart to demonstrate the numbers of beds per hospital, and a LHOC-graph tracking the values of a stock market graph contained within a CSV file.
Both graphs use D3.js to do everything, and I used a few libraries to get the job done - modifying the data as I went.
More information about how they work and what I used is contained within the scripts themselves, but for now...
